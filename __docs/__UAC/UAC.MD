1. Provide a count of accounts that are in the over 60-day group.

Notes from Servicing Demo

1. Summarization based on payment
				1. What's occurring on the account
				2. What's the delinquency
				3. Unstructure + payment contact (more structure)
				4. Currently time consuming process to get a recap
					1. Missing things that they shouldn't

2. Pull structured data from databases from EPI
	1. When you made a payment
	2. Summarization of payments
	3. Automation by summarizing the nodes
		1. e.g. called John 60 times
	4. Indicated that his medical bills
	5. There does appear to be an intend to pay

3. There will be PII in the North field
	1. Across servicing 1200-1300 collectors
	2. You are going to get creative abbreviations and PII

4. Cleanse / Scrap PII data before calling LLM

5. We need to see the data in Dev and use LLM in Dev

6. Combine several technologies into 1 scenario
	1. Summary from Genesys (from Raj)

7. There are multiple sources
	1. Transcript
		1. Genesys, go to the source
	2. Representative notes
		1. What happened
        2. What is my next steps

        1. Autosuite DM (default manager)

8. Subcommittee

Proposed hackathon to not include this work so as not to duplicate work

We need data of 3 categories from the Servicing Department
 

Transcriptions of the calls between customer and GMF service representative
Notes that were added by GMF service rep after the call
Records of payment history by the custome
